## Completed Contract Work

- [x] Inventory all governed Swift source files and public exports.
- [x] Document standard and PSK wire, cryptographic, blockchain, model, queue, cache, and storage behavior.
- [x] Map twelve stable requirements to deterministic native verification.
- [x] Preserve product source, tests, release workflows, and environment-dependent LocalNet validation unchanged.
- [x] Configure SpecSync and Trust to enforce 100% contract coverage.

## Known Boundaries

- Independent cryptographic audit is not represented as completed.
- External Algorand node, indexer, and LocalNet availability are not claimed by deterministic unit verification.
- The package remains pre-1.0, so future public contract changes require their own reviewed SpecSync lifecycle.

## Review Sign-offs

- **Product contract**: represented by the implemented public API and reviewed canonical requirements
- **Native verification**: 242 deterministic tests and the CLI product build pass
- **Governance**: portable definition and closing approvals are recorded through the SpecSync lifecycle
