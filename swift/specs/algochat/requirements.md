# Requirements

These normative requirements define the accepted contract for the implemented package.

### REQ-algochat-001

The package SHALL expose the Swift 6 `AlgoChat` library and `algochat` executable with strict concurrency enabled, async client operations, actor isolation for shared mutable state, and the declared Apple and Linux platform support. Hybrid ML-KEM methods SHALL be compiled only where `MLKEM768` exists. On Linux those methods are omitted and the rest of the library still builds.

#### Acceptance Criteria

- Package manifest exports `AlgoChat` and `algochat` with Swift 6 strict-concurrency settings.
- The deterministic build and CLI smoke test succeed on the supported runner.

### REQ-algochat-002

Standard envelopes SHALL encode version `0x01` and protocol `0x01`, validate the 32-byte static and ephemeral public keys, 12-byte nonce, 48-byte wrapped sender key, 126-byte header, and 4,096-byte note ceiling, and reject unsupported or truncated data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

- Standard envelope round trips preserve every field and reject invalid version, protocol, size, or length.
- An 882-byte plaintext still encodes. A maximum plaintext encodes to exactly 4,096 bytes. One extra byte is rejected before a transaction is sent.

### REQ-algochat-003

Standard message cryptography SHALL use fresh X25519 ephemeral agreement, HKDF-SHA256 domain separation, ChaCha20-Poly1305 authenticated encryption, signed identity binding, and sender-key wrapping so either participant can authenticate and decrypt authorized content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

- Both authorized participants decrypt valid standard messages and tampering fails authentication.
- Fresh ephemeral keys and signature verification are covered by deterministic cryptographic tests.

### REQ-algochat-004

Messages and conversations SHALL preserve transaction identity, sender, recipient, content, timestamp, confirmed round, direction, protocol mode, and optional reply context; reply previews must be limited to 80 characters and plain-text payloads must remain decodable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

- Message and conversation round trips retain identity, direction, protocol, and reply metadata.
- Reply previews do not exceed 80 characters and legacy plain text remains readable.

### REQ-algochat-005

Blockchain integration SHALL create and sign payment transactions containing valid note payloads, default to 1,000 microAlgos unless overridden, set the fee to the consensus note fee for that note, publish discoverable public-key metadata, page indexer searches, filter key-publication records, and optionally wait for confirmation and indexer visibility.

#### Acceptance Criteria

- Transaction construction honors default and custom payment amounts without exceeding the 4,096-byte note limit.
- At a minimum fee of 1,000 microAlgos, a 1,024-byte note costs 1,000, a 2,000-byte note costs 1,098, and a 4,096-byte note costs 1,308.
- Indexer tests cover paging, key discovery, publication filtering, confirmation, and visibility waits.

### REQ-algochat-006

PSK exchange URIs and contacts SHALL round-trip a valid Algorand address, exactly 32 bytes of pre-shared key material, and an optional label; malformed schemes, versions, addresses, keys, and persisted contacts must be rejected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

- Valid PSK URIs round-trip address, 32-byte key, and optional label.
- Malformed scheme, version, address, or key material is rejected.

### REQ-algochat-007

PSK envelopes SHALL use protocol `0x02`, encode a big-endian 32-bit counter in a 130-byte header, combine ratcheted PSK material with ephemeral ECDH, enforce the 4,096-byte note ceiling, and authenticate before exposing plaintext.

#### Acceptance Criteria

- PSK envelope round trips preserve its counter and fields while respecting the note ceiling.
- An 878-byte plaintext still encodes. A maximum PSK plaintext encodes to exactly 4,096 bytes.
- Tampering, invalid framing, or incorrect key material fails before plaintext is exposed.

### REQ-algochat-008

PSK state and management SHALL derive deterministic session and position keys, advance send counters, reject reused or out-of-window receive counters, record counters only after successful decryption, prune obsolete replay state, and persist contacts and state through `PSKStorage`.

#### Acceptance Criteria

- Send counters advance deterministically and receive counters are recorded only after authentication.
- Replays and out-of-window counters fail, and obsolete replay entries are pruned.

### REQ-algochat-009

The send queue SHALL persist pending messages and their retry state, provide deterministic enqueue/dequeue/remove/clear operations, retry only within the configured limit, remove successful sends, and surface permanent failures without falsely reporting delivery.

#### Acceptance Criteria

- Pending messages and retry state survive storage round trips.
- Successful messages are removed; exhausted messages report permanent failure without false delivery.

### REQ-algochat-010

Synchronization and caching SHALL distinguish online and syncing state, process queued work when a client is available, cache messages by participant without duplicates, preserve last-sync rounds, support pagination and conversation refresh, and permit scoped or complete invalidation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

- Cache and synchronization tests preserve online/syncing state, message uniqueness, and last-sync rounds.
- Scoped and complete invalidation plus pagination behave deterministically.

### REQ-algochat-011

Key and PSK storage SHALL preserve private key confidentiality and durable state: Apple platforms use Keychain and optional biometric controls, cross-platform file storage uses authenticated password-based protection where configured, and storage errors must not silently replace or disclose key material.

#### Acceptance Criteria

- Key/contact/state storage round trips and deletion succeed for available implementations.
- Corruption, invalid passwords, and unsupported platform capability return errors without disclosing key material.

### REQ-algochat-012

Verification SHALL build the owned library target and CLI product, run the 70-test cryptographic batch and 172-test unit and envelope-security batch, validate every governed source file and exported symbol at 100% SpecSync coverage, require the Codex integration to invoke the repository's strict 100% coverage command, and make no semantic changes to `Sources/` or `Tests/` during this migration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

- The Fledge lane passes 70 cryptographic tests, 172 other unit and envelope-security tests, and the noninteractive CLI product build.
- The Codex SpecSync skill invokes `specsync check --strict --require-coverage 100 --force` during PR validation.
- SpecSync strict coverage and quality score are 100%, with no changes under `Sources/` or `Tests/`.
