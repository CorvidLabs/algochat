> **Pre-1.0 Notice**: This library is under active development. The API may change between minor versions until 1.0.

> **Security Notice**: This library has not been independently audited. While it uses well-established cryptographic primitives from [swift-crypto](https://github.com/apple/swift-crypto), use in production is at your own risk.

Encrypted peer-to-peer messaging on the Algorand blockchain. Built with Swift 6 and async/await.

## Features

- **End-to-End Encryption** - X25519 key agreement + ChaCha20-Poly1305
- **No forward secrecy** - A long-term key opens that account's past messages. A fresh ephemeral key only separates message keys.
- **Quantum Defense-in-Depth** - Optional ratcheting PSK mode (protocol v1.1) provides hybrid X25519 + pre-shared key encryption
- **Replay Protection** - Counter-based sliding window for PSK messages
- **Immutable Messages** - Permanently recorded on-chain
- **Decentralized** - No central server controls delivery
- **Bidirectional Decryption** - Both sender and recipient can decrypt messages
- **Reply Support** - Thread conversations with reply context
- **Biometric Storage** - Protect encryption keys with Face ID / Touch ID
- **Cross-Implementation** - Compatible with [ts-algochat](https://github.com/CorvidLabs/ts-algochat), [rs-algochat](https://github.com/CorvidLabs/rs-algochat), [py-algochat](https://github.com/CorvidLabs/py-algochat), [kt-algochat](https://github.com/CorvidLabs/kt-algochat)
- **Multi-Platform** - iOS 15+, macOS 12+, tvOS 15+, watchOS 8+, visionOS 1+. The hybrid ML-KEM session needs macOS 26 and is not covered by a Linux CI job.

## Installation

### Swift Package Manager

Add AlgoChat to your `Package.swift`:

The package manifest is at the root of [CorvidLabs/algochat](https://github.com/CorvidLabs/algochat).

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/CorvidLabs/algochat.git", branch: "main")
]
```

Then add the dependency to your target:

```swift
.target(
    name: "YourApp",
    dependencies: [
        .product(name: "AlgoChat", package: "algochat")
    ]
)
```

Or add it via Xcode:
1. File > Add Package Dependencies
2. Enter: `https://github.com/CorvidLabs/swift-algochat.git`

## Quick Start

### Creating a Chat Client

```swift
import AlgoChat
import Algorand

// Create a new account
let account = try Account()

// Initialize chat client
let chat = try await AlgoChat(network: .testnet, account: account)
```

### Sending Messages

```swift
// Start a conversation
let recipient = try Address(string: "RECIPIENT_ADDRESS_HERE")
let conversation = try await chat.conversation(with: recipient)

// Send a message (wait for confirmation)
try await chat.send("Hello!", to: conversation, options: .confirmed)

// Send with indexer confirmation (guarantees visibility on refresh)
try await chat.send("Hello!", to: conversation, options: .indexed)

// Send a reply
if let lastMessage = conversation.lastReceived {
    try await chat.send("Thanks!", to: conversation, options: .replying(to: lastMessage))
}
```

### Fetching Messages

```swift
// Get all conversations
let conversations = try await chat.conversations()

// Refresh a specific conversation
let updated = try await chat.refresh(conversation)

// Access messages
for message in updated.messages {
    print("\(message.direction): \(message.content)")
}

// Filter by direction
let received = updated.receivedMessages
let sent = updated.sentMessages
```

### Publishing Your Key

Allow others to message you before you've sent them a message:

```swift
try await chat.publishKeyAndWait()
```

### PSK Mode (Quantum Defense-in-Depth)

PSK mode adds a pre-shared key layer on top of standard ECDH encryption, providing defense-in-depth against future quantum attacks on key exchange.

```swift
// Generate and share a PSK exchange URI
let psk = PSKExchangeURI(
    address: account.address.description,
    psk: Data.random(count: 32),
    label: "Alice"
)
let uri = psk.toString()
// Share uri out-of-band: algochat-psk://v1?addr=...&psk=...&label=Alice

// Import a PSK from a received URI
let received = try PSKExchangeURI.parse(uri)
let contact = PSKContact(
    address: received.address,
    initialPSK: received.psk,
    label: received.label
)

// Manage PSK contacts
let pskManager = PSKManager(storage: FilePSKStorage(directory: ".algochat"))
try await pskManager.addContact(contact)
```

## Core Concepts

### Encryption

Messages are encrypted using modern cryptographic primitives:

- **Key Agreement**: X25519 elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman
- **Encryption**: ChaCha20-Poly1305 authenticated encryption
- **Key Derivation**: HKDF-SHA256 with domain separation
- **Key separation**: A fresh ephemeral key per everyday message. This is not forward secrecy.

### Message Envelope Formats

**Standard Mode** (protocol `0x01`):

```
[version: 1][protocol: 1][sender_pubkey: 32][ephemeral_pubkey: 32][nonce: 12][encrypted_sender_key: 48][ciphertext: variable]
```

- **Header size**: 126 bytes
- **Maximum message**: 3954 bytes (after encryption overhead)

**PSK Ratcheting Mode** (protocol `0x02`):

```
[version: 1][protocol: 2][ratchet_counter: 4][sender_pubkey: 32][ephemeral_pubkey: 32][nonce: 12][encrypted_sender_key: 48][ciphertext: variable]
```

- **Header size**: 130 bytes
- **Maximum message**: 3950 bytes (after encryption overhead)

### Key Storage

```swift
// Biometric-protected storage (Apple platforms)
let storage = KeychainKeyStorage()
let chatAccount = try await ChatAccount(account: algorandAccount, storage: storage)

// Password-encrypted file storage (Linux/cross-platform)
let storage = FileKeyStorage(directory: ".algochat", password: "secret")
```

### Send Options

```swift
// Fire-and-forget (fastest)
try await chat.send("Hello!", to: conversation)

// Wait for blockchain confirmation
try await chat.send("Hello!", to: conversation, options: .confirmed)

// Wait for indexer (guarantees visibility)
try await chat.send("Hello!", to: conversation, options: .indexed)
```

## Architecture

There is no AlgoChat server. The library encrypts on your device, carries the envelope in the note of an Algorand payment, and reads it back through an indexer.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    app["Your app or the algochat CLI"] --> lib["AlgoChat<br/>derive keys, encrypt, sign"]
    lib -- "payment with encrypted note" --> algod["algod"]
    algod --> ledger[("Algorand ledger")]
    ledger --> indexer["Indexer"]
    indexer -- "search transactions, decrypt" --> lib
    lib <--> keys[("Keychain or ~/.algochat")]
```

The [high-level design](docs/HLD.md) covers the package targets, the protocol and wire formats, the send, receive, key-discovery and PSK flows as sequence diagrams, local storage, CI and releases, the trust model, and known limits.

## CLI Tool

The package includes an interactive command-line interface:

```bash
swift run algochat
```

## Testing

### Unit Tests

```bash
swift test
```

### Integration Tests (LocalNet)

```bash
# Start local Algorand network
algokit localnet start

# Run integration tests
swift test --filter "LocalnetIntegration"

# Stop localnet
algokit localnet stop
```

## Requirements

- Swift 6.0+
- iOS 15.0+ / macOS 12.0+ / tvOS 15.0+ / watchOS 8.0+ / visionOS 1.0+
- Linux is not covered by CI for the hybrid ML-KEM session. That session needs macOS 26.
- [AlgoKit CLI](https://github.com/algorandfoundation/algokit-cli) (optional, for localnet testing)
