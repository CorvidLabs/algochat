# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Security
- **Real PBKDF2 key derivation** - `FileKeyStorage` now performs genuine
  PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 at 100,000 iterations (CommonCrypto on Apple platforms,
  RFC 8018 HMAC-SHA256 on Linux). The previous implementation looped SHA-256
  and a single HKDF pass, which was not PBKDF2 and was not interoperable with
  the reference implementations. Key files keep the 92-byte format
  (salt 32 + nonce 12 + ciphertext 32 + tag 16).
- **Cryptographically secure randomness at rest** - `FileKeyStorage` salt and
  nonce generation now use the explicit platform CSPRNG path
  (`SecRandomCopyBytes` / `/dev/urandom`) and surface a thrown error instead of
  trapping when secure randomness is unavailable.
- **Signature-verified key discovery** - Key discovery verifies appended
  Ed25519 signatures over the announced X25519 key against the sender's
  Algorand address and reports the actual verification result; unsigned or
  invalid announcements are reported as unverified instead of trusted.
- **Envelope fields safe to index** - `ChatEnvelope` and `PSKEnvelope` now
  store zero-indexed `Data` for every field. CryptoKit sealed-box outputs and
  `Data` slice concatenation can carry a non-zero `startIndex`, which made
  integer subscripting (e.g. `envelope.ciphertext[0]`) trap. Fields are
  re-based on construction so indexing untrusted envelope data cannot crash.

### Changed
- CI runs the full test suite on macOS and Linux (the previous `--filter`
  expressions skipped the PSK, signature-verifier and file-key-storage
  suites). Localnet integration suites self-skip when localnet is unavailable.

### Added
- Tag-triggered release workflow that builds, tests, and publishes a GitHub
  release.
- PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 known-answer test vectors.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-10-16

### Changed
- **4096-byte notes** - An AlgoChat note may be 4096 bytes (protocol revision
  1.2.1). Standard plaintext maximum is 3954 bytes and PSK plaintext maximum
  is 3950 bytes. Envelope layout is unchanged. The first 1024 bytes still
  cost one minimum fee. Each byte past 1024 adds one ten-thousandth of the
  minimum fee, rounded up once. At a minimum fee of 1000 microAlgos, 1024
  bytes cost 1000, 2000 bytes cost 1098, and 4096 bytes cost 1308.

### Fixed
- `AlgoChat.init(network:)` propagates the error from swift-algokit's throwing
  network initializer.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-01-27

### Added
- **PSK messaging protocol v1.1** - Pre-shared key conversations with a
  per-message key schedule and replay protection. This is not forward secrecy.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-01-24

### Added
- **Custom payment amount** - Optional custom microAlgo amount when sending
  messages.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-01-08

### Fixed
- Use the Application Support directory for key storage on iOS.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-01-07

### Added
- Backward pagination for loading older messages.

### Fixed
- Restored `decryptSent` and simplified sender-side decryption so sent
  messages decrypt correctly when loaded from the blockchain.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-01-07

### Fixed
- Sent messages could not be decrypted when loaded from the blockchain.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-01-05

Initial public release.

### Added
- **Core messaging** - Send and receive encrypted messages on Algorand blockchain
- **End-to-end encryption** - X25519 key agreement + ChaCha20-Poly1305
- **Forward secrecy** - Per-message ephemeral keys protect past messages
- **Bidirectional decryption** - Both sender and recipient can decrypt messages
- **Reply support** - Thread conversations with reply context
- **Conversation management** - Track messages by participant
- **Key discovery** - Automatic public key lookup from transaction history
- **Public key publishing** - Announce encryption key via self-transaction
- **Biometric key storage** - Keychain integration with Face ID / Touch ID
- **File-based key storage** - Password-encrypted storage for Linux/non-Apple platforms
- **Message caching** - In-memory and file-based cache implementations
- **Send queue** - Persistent queue for offline message delivery
- **CLI tool** - Interactive command-line interface for testing

### Security
