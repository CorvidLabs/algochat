# Adopt SpecSync 5.0.1 and Trust 1.0.0 governance for Swift AlgoChat

## Intent

Adopt SpecSync 5.0.1 and Trust 1.0.0 governance for Swift AlgoChat

## Affected Canonical Specs

- None

## Acceptance Criteria

- SpecSync advisory coverage passes; all four agent integrations are installed; Trust doctor passes; Swift build, the two CI-safe test batches, and the CLI smoke test pass; existing Linux, macOS, documentation, and release workflows remain green.

## No-spec Rationale

This migration adds governance configuration and CI orchestration without changing the Swift protocol implementation; future meaningful implementation changes must add or update canonical specifications.
