# Adopt SpecSync 5.0.1 and Trust 1.0.0 governance for the Python AlgoChat implementation

## Intent

Adopt SpecSync 5.0.1 and Trust 1.0.0 governance for the Python AlgoChat implementation

## Affected Canonical Specs

- None

## Acceptance Criteria

- SpecSync strict validation passes at advisory threshold 0; all four agent integrations report installed; Trust doctor and native verification pass; Ruff and the full Python protocol test suite pass; existing Python version matrix and PyPI publishing remain intact.

## No-spec Rationale

This migration changes governance and CI orchestration only; the Python protocol implementation and public contract are unchanged and no canonical spec currently exists in this repository.
