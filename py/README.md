> **Pre-1.0 Notice**: This library is under active development. The API may change between minor versions until 1.0.

Python implementation of the AlgoChat protocol for encrypted messaging on Algorand.

## Installation

> **Note**: `py-algochat` is not yet published to PyPI. The first tagged release
> will publish automatically via GitHub Actions (PyPI Trusted Publishing). Until
> then, install from source:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/CorvidLabs/py-algochat.git
```

Once published, install from PyPI:

```bash
pip install py-algochat
```

## Usage

```python
from algochat import derive_keys_from_seed, encrypt_message, decrypt_message
from algochat import encode_envelope, decode_envelope

# Derive keys from a 32-byte seed (e.g., from Algorand account)
sender_private, sender_public = derive_keys_from_seed(seed_bytes)
recipient_private, recipient_public = derive_keys_from_seed(recipient_seed)

# Encrypt a message
envelope = encrypt_message(
    "Hello, World!",
    sender_private,
    sender_public,
    recipient_public,
)

# Encode for transmission
encoded = encode_envelope(envelope)

# Decode received message
decoded = decode_envelope(encoded)

# Decrypt as recipient
result = decrypt_message(decoded, recipient_private, recipient_public)
print(result.text)  # "Hello, World!"
```

## Encrypted Key Storage

Private encryption keys can be persisted to disk with at-rest encryption using
`FileKeyStorage`. Keys are encrypted with AES-256-GCM using a key derived from a
password via PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 (100,000 iterations) and written to
`~/.algochat/keys/<address>.key` with `0600` permissions. The on-disk format
(`salt | nonce | ciphertext | tag`, 92 bytes) interoperates with the Rust
implementation.

```python
from algochat import FileKeyStorage

storage = FileKeyStorage(password="a strong passphrase")
await storage.store(private_key_bytes, address)
recovered = await storage.retrieve(address)
```

For tests and ephemeral use, `InMemoryKeyStorage` stores keys unencrypted in
memory and is not suitable for production.

## Protocol

AlgoChat uses:
- **X25519** for key agreement
- **ChaCha20-Poly1305** for authenticated encryption
- **HKDF-SHA256** for key derivation

The protocol supports bidirectional decryption, allowing senders to decrypt their own messages.

## PSK v1.1 Protocol

The PSK (Pre-Shared Key) v1.1 protocol adds a shared secret layer on top of the standard X25519 key agreement, providing forward secrecy through a two-level ratchet system.

```python
from algochat import (
    derive_keys_from_seed,
    derive_psk_at_counter,
    encrypt_psk_message,
    decrypt_psk_message,
    encode_psk_envelope,
    decode_psk_envelope,
    is_psk_message,
    PSKState,
    advance_send_counter,
    validate_counter,
    record_receive,
    create_psk_exchange_uri,
    parse_psk_exchange_uri,
)

# Derive keys
sender_private, sender_public = derive_keys_from_seed(sender_seed)
recipient_private, recipient_public = derive_keys_from_seed(recipient_seed)

# Shared PSK (exchanged out-of-band)
initial_psk = os.urandom(32)

# Manage counter state
state = PSKState()
counter, state = advance_send_counter(state)

# Derive ratcheted PSK for this counter
current_psk = derive_psk_at_counter(initial_psk, counter)

# Encrypt with PSK
envelope = encrypt_psk_message(
    "Hello with PSK!",
    sender_private,
    sender_public,
    recipient_public,
    current_psk,
    counter,
)

# Encode for transmission
encoded = encode_psk_envelope(envelope)
assert is_psk_message(encoded)

# Decode and decrypt
decoded = decode_psk_envelope(encoded)
psk_for_counter = derive_psk_at_counter(initial_psk, decoded.ratchet_counter)
text = decrypt_psk_message(decoded, recipient_private, recipient_public, psk_for_counter)

# Exchange PSK via URI
uri = create_psk_exchange_uri(address, initial_psk, label="My Chat")
parsed = parse_psk_exchange_uri(uri)
```

### PSK Ratchet

The ratchet derives unique keys per message using a two-level hierarchy:
- **Session PSK**: Derived from initial PSK + session index (every 100 messages)
- **Position PSK**: Derived from session PSK + position within session

### PSK Counter State

Counter state tracks send/receive counters with replay protection:
- Rejects duplicate counters (replay attacks)
- Maintains a sliding window (200 messages) for out-of-order delivery
- Prunes old counters automatically
