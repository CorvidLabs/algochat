# Python AlgoChat Protocol

#### Standard Protocol and Models

The standard protocol surface covers deterministic and ephemeral X25519 keys, authenticated encryption, envelope encoding, key signatures, message models, conversations, replies, and delivery results.

#### Storage, Queue, Transport, and Client

The persistence and transport surface separates message caches, encrypted key storage, queued delivery, Algorand node/indexer abstractions, key discovery, and the high-level `AlgoChat` coordinator.

#### Errors

The explicit exception hierarchy keeps protocol, cryptographic, transport, address, balance, lookup, and persistence failures distinguishable.

#### PSK Protocol

The PSK v1.1 surface covers wire constants, hierarchical ratchet derivation, hybrid authenticated encryption, replay-safe receive state, and exchange URI handling.

## Invariants

1. Standard messages use the existing X25519, HKDF-SHA256, and ChaCha20-Poly1305 construction and remain decryptable by the intended recipient and originating sender.
2. Encoded standard and PSK envelopes preserve the established cross-implementation wire format.
3. PSK counters derive deterministic per-message keys, reject replays, allow the configured out-of-order window, and prune obsolete receive state.
4. File key storage encrypts private material at rest and preserves the interoperable salt, nonce, ciphertext, and tag layout; in-memory storage remains test-only.
5. Blockchain, queue, and client abstractions preserve asynchronous ordering and do not silently discard protocol errors.
6. A standard plaintext is at most 3954 bytes and a PSK plaintext is at most 3950 bytes. Those maxima encode to a 4096-byte note. One extra byte is rejected before a transaction is built. Headers stay 126 and 130 bytes, and the Poly1305 tag stays 16 bytes. Plaintexts of 882 and 878 bytes still encrypt, and those notes stay at most 1024 bytes.
7. A note payment fee is one minimum fee plus the consensus surcharge for bytes past 1024. With a minimum fee of 1000 microAlgos, notes of 1024, 2000, and 4096 bytes cost 1000, 1098, and 1308 microAlgos. This library does not add a Falcon signer.

## Behavioral Examples

```text
Given two AlgoChat key pairs and an authenticated plaintext
When the sender encrypts and encodes an envelope for the recipient
Then the recipient decodes and decrypts the original plaintext and tampering fails authentication

Given a standard plaintext of 3954 bytes or a PSK plaintext of 3950 bytes
When the sender encrypts and encodes the envelope
Then the note is 4096 bytes, and one extra plaintext byte is rejected before a transaction is built

Given minimum fee 1000 and notes of 1024, 2000, and 4096 bytes
When the payment fee is chosen
Then the fees are 1000, 1098, and 1308 microAlgos
```

## Error Cases

| Error | When | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| Invalid envelope | Encoded data has an unsupported marker, length, or field layout | Reject decoding without returning unauthenticated plaintext |
| Authentication failure | Ciphertext, associated data, key material, or signature is invalid | Raise the existing protocol error |
| Replay | A PSK receive counter was already processed or is outside the accepted window | Reject the message and preserve valid state |
| Missing key or message | Storage, queue, or transport lookup cannot resolve the requested item | Return or raise the existing explicit absence result |
| Message too large | Plaintext exceeds 3954 bytes (standard) or 3950 bytes (PSK) | Reject before a transaction is built |

## Corrected Model and Discovery Contracts

- `DiscoveredKey` stores an X25519 public key and its Ed25519 verification state; it does not store an address or source transaction.
- `SendOptions` configures confirmation and indexer waits, their timeouts, and optional reply context; it does not publish keys.
- `SendResult` stores the transaction identifier and resulting sent `Message`; it does not expose a confirmed-round field.
- `discover_encryption_key` returns the first valid key announcement in indexer result order and does not promise latest-key ordering.
